                    <strong>With insightful opinions and advice, this blog shares tremendous knowledge concerning with
                        stress-related issues. I'm Harvey, a post-graduate student at BFSU, who had also been haunted by
                        stress for many years. Read my blog and you will learn how to live a happy life, even when
                        you're in agony.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have never anticipated me to be the stressful one, not least before I enrolled in university six
                    years ago.
                    I'd seen people getting agitated, becoming confused or even committing suicide because of stress,
                    but only on television.
                    It's always easy to watch others suffer. But when the overwhelming stress dawned upon you, you will
                    suffer, too.
                </p>

                    Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause
                    stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new or unexpected that threatens our
                    sense of self or when we feel we have little control over a situation.
                    We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life
                    events, personality and social and economic circumstances.
                    When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response
                    and activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous situations.
                    Sometimes, this stress response can be helpful. It can help us push through fear or pain so we can
                    run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones usually return to normal
                    quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects.
                    However, too much stress can cause adverse effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of fight or
                    flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our physical and mental
                    health.
                </p>

                    Many things can lead to stress: bereavement, divorce or separation, losing a job or unexpected money
                    problems. Work-related stress can also have a negative impact on your mental health. People affected
                    by work-related stress lose an average of 24 days of work due to ill health.
                    Even positive life changes, such as moving to a bigger house, gaining a job promotion or going on
                    holiday, can be sources of stress. If you feel stressed in these situations, you may struggle to
                    understand why or be unwilling to share your feelings with others.
                </p>

                    If you continue to feel overwhelmed by stress, don’t be afraid to seek professional help. It doesn’t
                    mean you’re a failure. Getting help as soon as possible is important so you can start feeling
                    better.
                    Talk to your doctor about how you’re feeling. They should be able to advise you on treatment and may
                    refer you for further help. They may suggest talking therapies such as:
                    Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which helps reduce stress by changing the ways you think about
                    stressful situations;
                    brief interpersonal counselling, which can give you the chance to talk about what causes you stress
                    and develop coping strategies
                    or some mindfulness-based approaches.
                    If your stress is work-related, our page on work-life balance may help. If you feel comfortable,
                    talk to your manager or HR team about how you're feeling to see if they can make changes to your
                    workload or hours. You could contact your workplace for confidential support or counselling if your
                    workplace has an Employee Assistance Scheme.
