                    <h3>What impacts you most may not be the same as for someone else</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Stress is normal and, to some extent, </strong>
                        a necessary part of life. Despite it being something everyone experiences, what causes stress
                        can differ from person to person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>For instance, one person may become angry and overwhelmed by a serious traffic jam, while
                            another might turn up their music and consider it a mild inconvenience. A fight with a
                            friend might follow one person around for the rest of the day, while another might easily
                            shrug it off.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's causing you stress may already be something you're abundantly aware of. But given the
                        importance of keeping stress in check when it comes to mitigating the effects it can have on
                        your physical and mental health, it's worth opening yourself up to the possibility that other
                        factors may be at play, too. Craft your stress-reduction plan with all of them in mind.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Financial Problems</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to the American Psychological Association (APA), money is the top cause of stress in
                        the United States. In a 2015 survey, the APA reported that 72% of Americans stressed about money
                        at least some of the time during the previous month. The majority of the study participants
                        reported money being a significant source of stress, with 77% feeling considerable anxiety about
                        finances.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the long-term, stress related to finances results in distress, which may bring up blood
                        pressure and cause headaches, upset stomach, chest pain, insomnia, and a general feeling of
                        sickness. Financial stress has also been linked to a number of health problems, including
                        depression, anxiety, skin problems, diabetes, and arthritis.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Americans now spend 8% more
                        time at work compared to 20 years ago, and about 13% of people work a second job. At least 40%
                        report their jobs are stressful, and 26% report they often feel burned out by their work.

                                Any number of things can contribute to job stress, including too much work, job

                    <p>Whether you are worried about a specific project or feeling unfairly treated, putting your job
                        ahead of everything else can affect many aspects of your life, including personal relationships
                        and mental and physical health.</p>
                    <p>Factors outside of the job itself also have a role in work stress, including a personâ€™s
                        psychological make-up, general health, personal life. and the amount of emotional support they
                        have outside of work.</p>
                    <p>The signs of work-related stress can be physical and psychological, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Anxiety</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Personal Relationship</h3>
                    <p>There are people in all of our lives that cause us stress. It could be a family member, an
                        intimate partner, friend, or co-worker. Toxic people lurk in all parts of our lives and the
                        stress we experience from these relationships can affect physical and mental health.</p>
                    <p>
                        There are numerous causes of stress in romantic relationships and when couples are constantly
                        under pressure, the relationship could be on the risk of failure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common relationship stressors include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being too busy to spend time with each other and share responsibilities<br></li>
                        <li>Intimacy and sex are become rare due to busyness, health problems, and any number of other
                        reasons<br></li>
                        <li>There is abuse or control in the relationship<br></li>
                        <li>You and your partner are not communicating</li>
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote>
                        <cite>
                            <a>
                        The signs of stress related to personal relationships are similar to normal symptoms of general
                        stress and may include physical health and sleep problems, depression, and anxiety.
                            </a>

                    <p>
                        You may also find yourself avoiding or having conflict with the individual, or becoming easily
                        irritated by their presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, personal relationship stress can also be related to our relationships with people on
                        social media platforms, such as Facebook. For example, social media tends to naturally encourage
                        comparing yourself to others, which can lead to the stress of feeling inadequate. It also makes
                        bullying easier.
